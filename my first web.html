    <h1>Redmi 9 prime modal</h1><br>
    <p>Xioami recently launched Redmi Note 9. However, the effect of increase in GST rate and weak rupee has definitely been seen in the budget and mid-range market. If we look at the pre-Redmi Note 9 siblings, the Redmi Note 9 should have ideally started at Rs. 9,999. Although the company has launched this phone for Rs 11,999 for the reasons mentioned above. So, customers with tight budgets had no option but to pay for premium phones or look at other brands. For this reason, now the company has launched Redmi 9 Prime, which starts at <b>Rs 9,999</b> and comes with MediaTek Helio G80 chipset. Can Redmi 9 Prime offer good value for its price? We got to spend some time with the Redmi 9 Prime and here we are going to give our initial opinion about this phone.</p>
   <H><b>Display</b></H><br>
   <p> The Redmi 9 Prime packs a 6.53-inch full-HD+ display that includes a notch at the top. The full-HD+ resolution display is a big advantage for the Redmi 9 Prime, as most of the competition is offering HD+ displays at this price point. The bezels around the panel are thick, but considering this price, not that much of a compromise. The display has Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for protection, which can protect the phone from minor scratches in everyday use.</p>
   <H><b>Battery</b></H><br>
   <p>Xiaomi has given a 5,020mAh battery in the Redmi 9 Prime. This is the same capability as the Redmi Note 9 (Review) and Redmi Note 9 Pro (Review). We have already reviewed the Note 9 series, so expect the Prime’s battery to offer decent backup as well. However, the downside is that the Redmi 9 Prime weighs 198 grams. You start noticing it after using the phone for a while. Xiaomi says that the Redmi 9 Prime is capable of 18W fast charging, but the company gives you a 10W charger in the box. Looking at the accompanying charger and battery capacity, we think the Redmi 9 Prime will take a long time to charge.</p>
   <H><b>Processor</b></H><br>
   <p>To power the Redmi 9 Prime, Xiaomi has chosen the <strong>MediaTek Helio G80</strong> chipset. It is an octa-core chipset, with two Cortex-A75 cores and six Cortex-A55 cores. The smartphone is available in two variants – 4GB RAM with 64GB storage and 4GB RAM with 128GB storage. Their price is Rs 9,999 and Rs 11,999 respectively. We have a high-end model.</p>
   <H><b>Camara</b></H><br>
   <p>The Redmi 9 Prime has a quad-camera setup at the back. Below them is a capacitive fingerprint scanner. This setup reminded us of Redmi Note 8 Pro. In the setup of this phone, Xiaomi has given a 13-megapixel primary camera with 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle, 5-megapixel macro and 2-megapixel depth.</p>
